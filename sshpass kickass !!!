The easiest way is to use sshpass. This is available in Ubuntu/Debian repos and you don't have to deal with integrating expect with bash.

An example:

sshpass -p<password> ssh <arguments>
sshpass -ptest1324 ssh user@192.168.1.200 ls -l /tmp

apt-get install sshpass

.... can remote connect to vps and send bash commands , right from local bash script like ovh ! cool
