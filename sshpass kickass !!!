The easiest way is to use sshpass. This is available in Ubuntu/Debian repos and you don't have to deal with integrating expect with bash.

An example:

#!/bin/bash -x
sshpass -p 'password' ssh user@website.com -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no


this > -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no   bypass if your key has changed. 

 

apt-get install sshpass

.... can remote connect to vps and send bash commands , right from local bash script like ovh ! cool
