This is a how-to to on installing and setting up lighttpd and PHP on Maverick. Lighttpd or "lighty" is a webserver with a very low use of resources.

Install the packages we need: (this may not be all, but these two will automatically download the rest as dependencies)

sudo apt-get install lighttpd php5-cgi

Enable the fastcgi module and the php configuration with

sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi 
sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php

Reload the lighttpd daemon

sudo service lighttpd force-reload

To test if it's working create the file /var/www/index.php with the following contents:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

and check out http://localhost/index.php in your browser.
